    ## Create actionable notifications from a Home Assistant To-do list!
    
    These actionable notifications are sent every day at the time you specify in *Notification Time*.
    They are sent to the every device you specify in *Devices to Notify*.
    It will generate 1 notification for each passed due item, with the ability to mark the item as completed right from the notification!
    ## When a Task is marked complete (from the notification):
    
    - The notifications will be **cleared from all devices it was sent to**!  
      This way, if a task is marked as done noone has a notification telling them to complete it.
    - Through the **When chore is completed.** actions you can specify any actions you would like to happen after a task is marked as done.

        If you need something to happen after a chore is completed you can do so here.
        **Note:** These actions will only run if the chore is marked done *via the notification*.
        The **todo_item** variable will contain the name of the item on the To-do list that was marked completed.
        This way to can use conditions to specify an action for a particular chore. For example you could use a counter helper to keep track of how much of something is "in stock" and when a specific chore is completed increment or decrement the counter.
