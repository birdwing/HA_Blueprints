# 🌐 This my Home Assistant Blueprint Library

Script Blueprints can be found in the [Scripts]([README.md](https://github.com/birdwing/HA_Blueprints/scripts) folder and Automation Blueprints can be found in the [Automations](https://github.com/birdwing/HA_Blueprints/automations) folder.
Each Blueprint has a file with the .yaml suffix with all the code that can be imported into Home Assistant.
Some of the more compliated Blueprints will also have a file with the .md suffix which is a markdown description to help with set-up and usage of the blueprint.
Always check The .md file if it exists because it will contain important information and if you want a successful install, you should read it.

## 🔃 Automations

### 🔔 To-do List Chore Notifications

This is an automation Blueprint that generates actionable notifications from a Home Assistant To-do list.
These actionable notifications are sent every day at the time you specify, through the notify service that you enter.
It will generate 1 notification for each passed due item, with the ability to mark the item as completed right from the notification.
