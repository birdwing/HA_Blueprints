# 🌐 This my Home Assistant Blueprint Library

Script Blueprints can be found in the [Scripts]([README.md](https://github.com/birdwing/HA_Blueprints/scripts) folder and Automation Blueprints can be found in the [Automations](https://github.com/birdwing/HA_Blueprints/automations) folder.
Each Blueprint has a file with the .yaml suffix with all the code that can be imported into Home Assistant.
Some of the more compliated Blueprints will also have a file with the .md suffix which is a markdown description to help with set-up and usage of the blueprint.
Always check The .md file if it exists because it will contain important information and if you want a successful install, you should read it.
