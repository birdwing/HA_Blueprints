# üåê This my Home Assistant Blueprint Library

Script Blueprints can be found in the [Scripts](https://github.com/birdwing/HA_Blueprints/scripts) folder and Automation Blueprints can be found in the [Automations](https://github.com/birdwing/HA_Blueprints/automations) folder.
Each Blueprint has it's own folder. Inside that folder is a file with the .yaml suffix with all the code that can be imported into Home Assistant.
Some of the more compliated Blueprints will also have a file README.md file to help with set-up and usage of the blueprint.
Always check The README.md file if it exists because it will contain important information and if you want a successful install, you should read it.

# üìÉ The Big List üìÉ

Here is a list of each of my blueprints, a quick description, an import link for import to Home Assistant, and jump links to the files in my GIT Repo...

## üîÉ Automations

### üîî To-do List Chore Notifications

This is an automation Blueprint that generates actionable notifications from a Home Assistant To-do list.
These actionable notifications are sent every day at the time you specify, through the notify service that you enter.
It will generate 1 notification for each passed due item, with the ability to mark the item as completed right from the notification.
There is also an optional *When chore is completed* actions section. This allows you to define actions to run when any chore is marked complete (from the notification). There is also a variable called "todo_item" which holds the name of the completed action. Using this variable along with conditions it is possible to run different actions based on the name of the completed chore.
